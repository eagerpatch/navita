# Navita CLI

Navita CLI is a command line interface for Navita.

Since more and more UI libraries are moving to a "copy and paste" approach, Navita CLI is a tool to help you with that.

We provide a small wrapper around [https://ui.shadcn.com/](shadcn/ui),
that adds and converts their Tailwind-based components to Navita components that uses Navita.

This is a work in progress. Expect breaking changes, and non-working versions until we reach 1.0.0 of the CLI.

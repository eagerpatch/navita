# Navita CLI

Navita CLI is a command line interface for Navita.

Since more and more UI libraries are moving to a "copy and paste" approach, Navita CLI is a tool to help you with that.

We provide a small wrapper around [https://ui.shadcn.com/](shadcn/ui),
that adds and converts their Tailwind-based components to Navita.

This is a work in progress. Expect breaking changes, and non-working versions until we reach 1.0.0 of the CLI.

If you only want to use Navita, you don't need to install this package.

Please check out the getting started guide at https://navita.style/.
